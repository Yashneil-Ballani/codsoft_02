Task 02 - Student garde calculator


The program takes input for marks obtained in each subject, sums up the total marks achieved across all subjects, and then calculates the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. It further determines the grade based on the average percentage achieved. The results, including the total marks, average percentage, and assigned grade, are then displayed to the user, providing a comprehensive overview of academic performance. This straightforward process allows users to quickly assess their overall performance and corresponding grade based on the entered subject marks.
